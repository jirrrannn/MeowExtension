# MeowExtension

## Description

The Meow Extension is a fun Chrome extension that allows users to add interactive cats to their web pages. Users can choose from four different types of cats, drag them to a specific position on the page, and watch them walk around, meow, and jump towards the mouse cursor. Users can also enable a sleeping mode for the cats and remove them from the page.
